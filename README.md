# Pokémon 3D Models
Welcome to the **Pokémon 3D Model Viewer**! This project allows users to view Pokémon in 3D using the `<model-viewer>` component. The app fetches data about Pokémon, displays their names, and lets users preview 3D models of various Pokémon.

## Using the API

To fetch Pokémon data from this project for use in your own applications, you can consult the [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29725199/2sAYX8KMU8) or examine the provided [`example.html`](./example.html) file. Modify the example as needed for your specific use case, or follow these steps:

### API Endpoint
The Pokémon data is exposed as a JSON API. You can access it using the following URL:
```
https://pokemon3d-api.onrender.com/v1/
```

You can use this endpoint to fetch the JSON data and use it in your applications to display Pokémon 3D models.

Example of fetching data with JavaScript:
```
fetch('https://pokemon3d-api.onrender.com/v1/${Form}')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); 
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

## How to Add More Models

To add new Pokémon models to the app, follow these steps:

1. **Find or Create a 3D Model**: Search for Pokémon 3D models that are in `.glb` or `.gltf` formats. You can find models on various 3D model websites or create your own.
2. **Update the `Regular.json`**: 
    - Add an entry for the new Pokémon.
    - Set the `model` property to the path of the 3D model.
    Example:
    ```json
   {
      "id": 25,
      "name": "Shiny Pikachu",
      "model": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D/main/models/glb/shiny/25.glb",
      "JsxComp": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D/main/models/gltfjsx/shiny/25.jsx"
    },
    ```
3. **Ensure the Model is Hosted**: You can either host the model yourself or use an external link to the model file. Ensure the model is accessible from the project.

## Converting .glb Models to JSX Components

For developers using JSX/Next.js, working with `.glb` models directly can be challenging. Instead, we can convert `.glb` files to `.jsx` components, which makes rendering and interaction easier.

### Steps to Convert `.glb` to `.jsx`

1. **Install `gltfjsx`**  
   First, install the required package globally or locally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm i gltfjsx
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   Move to the directory where your `.glb` file is stored:
   ```
   cd models/glb/
   ```
3. **Run the Conversion Command**
   Use the following command to convert a `.glb` file into a `.jsx` component:
   ```
   npx gltfjsx 150.glb -o ../../gltfjsx/shadow/150.jsx
   ```
   - 150.glb → The input .glb file
   - -o ../../gltfjsx/shadow/150.jsx → Output directory for the .jsx file
4. **Ensuring Default Export** After conversion, make sure the generated `.jsx` file exports the model as a default component. 
  If not, update the export statement at the end of the file:
  ```
  const  bulbasaur= (props) => {
  ---Content leave as it is---
  export default bulbasaur;
  ```
  This ensures that the component can be imported correctly without causing errors.


## Dependencies
```
cd server
npm i --save express
npm i --save-dev nodemon
npm i mongodb mongoose dotenv

npm init -y && npm install express mongoose body-parser cors
node server.js
```

## Pokémon Categories and Counts

## Note About APIs
While there are many Pokémon APIs available that provide Pokémon data (e.g., stats, types, moves, etc.), most of these APIs do not offer 3D models of Pokémon.  This is primarily due to the significant storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and serving 3D models, as well as potential licensing issues.  Existing APIs like [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) are excellent resources for general Pokémon information, but they do not include 3D models.

## Check Model Animations
To verify whether a model contains animations or to inspect its structure, you can use the **[3D Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitkumartoshniwal.3d-preview)** extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension allows you to preview 3D models directly in the editor, making it easier to inspect and test your models.
1. Upload your `.glb` or `.gltf` file to Visual Studio Code, or open it using Visual Studio Code.  
2. If the extension is set as the default, you can easily open the 3D model from the sidebar or by right-clicking the file and selecting **3D Preview**.  
3. If the model contains animations, they will appear in a dropdown menu; otherwise, no animations will be shown.
