## Features
- View Pokémon in 3D directly in the browser.
- Click on a Pokémon to preview its 3D model in a modal view.
- The app fetches Pokémon data dynamically from a JSON file or MongoDB, displaying it in a grid layout.
- Easy to extend by adding new Pokémon 3D models.

## Using the API

If you want to fetch Pokémon data from this project to use in your own applications, follow these steps:

### API Endpoint
The Pokémon data is exposed as a JSON API. You can access it using the following URL:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D-Models/main/PokeData.json
```

You can use this endpoint to fetch the JSON data and use it in your applications to display Pokémon 3D models.

Example of fetching data with JavaScript:
```
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D-Models/main/PokeData.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); 
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

## How to Add More Models

To add new Pokémon models to the app, follow these steps:

1. **Find or Create a 3D Model**: Search for Pokémon 3D models that are in `.glb` or `.gltf` formats. You can find models on various 3D model websites or create your own.
2. **Update the `PokeData.json`**: 
    - Add an entry for the new Pokémon.
    - Set the `model` property to the path of the 3D model.
    Example:
    ```json
   {
      "id": 25,
      "name": "Pikachu",
      "model": "./models/25.glb"
    },
    ```
3. **Ensure the Model is Hosted**: You can either host the model yourself or use an external link to the model file. Ensure the model is accessible from the project.

## Dependencies
```
cd test
npm init -y && npm install express mongoose body-parser cors
node server.js
```

## Checklist for Pokémon Models

We are tracking the availability of Pokémon 3D models. View the full checklist here:  

➡️ [Pokémon Model Checklist](./Pokemon%20List.xlsx)  

### Symbol Key  
Here’s what each symbol represents:  
- ✅: Model is **Available** and does not need replacement.  
- 🔂: Model **Needs to be Replaced** with a better version or updated.  
- 🚫: Model is **Not Available** and must be added.  

## Note About APIs

While there are many **Pokémon APIs** available that provide Pokémon data (e.g., stats, types, moves, etc.), **most of these APIs do not offer 3D models** of Pokémon. 

- **Why don't these APIs provide 3D models?**: Providing 3D models requires significant storage and bandwidth. Models are often large in size (several MBs), and hosting them for free or for public use can be difficult due to storage and bandwidth limitations.
- **Why don't we use other APIs?**: While you can retrieve detailed Pokémon information (like types, stats, and abilities) from APIs like [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/), these services typically do not provide 3D models. As a result, it would be challenging to include those models in this app without substantial storage for model files.

## Check Model Animations

To verify whether a model contains animations or to inspect its structure, you can use the **[GLTF Viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)**.  
1. Upload your `.glb` or `.gltf` file to the viewer.  
2. Check the **Animations** tab to confirm if any animations are included with the model.  
3. Use this tool to test your models before adding them to the project.

## Test the Viewer

Additionally, you can test the model viewer with the **Example.html** file included in the project. This file allows you to input a Pokémon ID and see if the 3D model is fetched from the api and displayed correctly in the browser.

To use this, simply open the `Example.html` file in your browser, enter a Pokémon ID, and click **Load Pokémon Model**. The viewer will fetch the 3D model from the API and display it. This serves as a test to ensure that the models are being fetched correctly and can also give you an idea of how to fetch and display Pokémon models in your own projects.

By using this example, you can verify if the API is working as expected and get familiar with how to integrate and display Pokémon 3D models in your app.
